              -1  take the next step with a new value of h,
                  n, meth, miter, and/or matrix parameters.
              -2  take the next step with a new value of h,
                  but with other inputs unchanged.

   kflag = a completion code with the following meanings:

             0  the step was successful,
            -1  the requested error could not be achieved,
            -2  corrector convergence could not be achieved,
